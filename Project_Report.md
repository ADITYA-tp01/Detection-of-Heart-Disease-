# Project Report: Heart Disease Detection


**Project:** Heart Disease Prediction Capstone

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning system for the early detection of heart disease. Using a dataset of patient health metrics, we explored, preprocessed, and modeled the data to identify the most effective classifier. The final solution is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application** that allows users to input health parameters and receive real-time risk assessments.

## 2. Project Objective

To build a predictive model that can accurately classify patients with and without heart disease, minimizing false negatives (high recall) to ensure potential cases are not missed. The solution must be accessible via a user-friendly interface.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Analysis & Preprocessing
-   **Dataset:** `heart_1.csv` containing attributes like Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp), Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol, etc.
-   **Cleaning:** The dataset was checked for missing values and inconsistencies.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Univariate and bivariate analysis were performed to understand feature distributions and correlations.
-   **Feature Engineering:**
    -   **Categorical Variables:** One-Hot Encoded (e.g., `cp`, `thal`, `slope`).
    -   **Numerical Variables:** Standard Scaled to normalize ranges (crucial for distance-based algorithms like SVM).

### 3.2 Model Development
We trained and evaluated four different machine learning models:
1.  **Decision Tree (DT):** A baseline interpretability model.
2.  **Random Forest (RF):** An ensemble method for better generalization.
3.  **Logistic Regression (LR):** A linear baseline.
4.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful classifier for high-dimensional spaces.

### 3.3 Model Selection Strategy
The primary evaluation metric was **Recall for Class 1 (Disease)**. In medical diagnostics, identifying all positive cases is critical; finding a healthy person "at risk" (False Positive) is preferable to missing a sick person (False Negative).

## 4. Results & Findings

After rigorous comparison, the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** was selected as the best performing model.

| Metric | SVM Performance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Recall (Class 1)** | **Highest** (Optimized) |
| **Precision** | Balanced |
| **F1-Score** | Robust |

*Note: Specific metric values are recorded in `artifacts/model_comparison.csv` generated by the analysis notebook.*

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Technical Stack
-   **Language:** Python 3.14
-   **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-   **App Framework:** Streamlit
-   **Serialization:** Pickle

### 5.2 Artifacts
The training process produces three key files in the `artifacts/` directory:
1.  `best_model.pkl`: The optimized SVM classifier.
2.  `scaler.pkl`: The StandardScaler object (essential for normalizing new user input).
3.  `model_columns.pkl`: A list of training feature columns to ensuring correct data alignment during inference.

### 5.3 Web Application (`app.py`)
A user-friendly interface was developed with the following features:
-   **Input Sidebar:** Sliders for numerical inputs (Age, Chol, etc.) and dropdowns for categorical inputs (Sex, CP Type, etc.).
-   **Real-Time Processing:** Inputs are dynamically encoded and scaled to match the training data format.
-   **Instant Feedback:** Visual indicators (Green/Red) for Low/High risk.
-   **Confidence Scores:** Displays diagnostic probabilities.

## 6. Conclusion

The "Detection of Heart Disease" project successfully delivered a high-recall predictive tool packaged in an accessible web application. By leveraging SVM and ensuring rigorous preprocessing consistency between training and inference, the system provides reliable risk assessments to aid in early diagnosis.
